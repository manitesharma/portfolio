                <p class="text-heading">In A Nutshell</p>
                <p class="text-body">Pydroid is a Technical Education Institute which provide summer training to College students in (Programming, Web Development & Designing). While all lectures will be delivered offline Online Dashboard will be used for smooth functioning of the programme and keeping record of all the events and data that will happen during the 6 week of course.</p>
                
                <p class="text-heading">Understanding the problem</p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    What does targeted audience look like?<br>
                    Do we need an Online Interface?<br>
                    What features are required and are necessary?<br>
                    How the dashboard will be used?<br>
                    Features that user will need to use most frequently?<br>
                    How much time they can/will spend on that dashboard?<br>
                    Why will they visit the Dashboard?<br>
                    If user is not on dashboard how will we notify if something important comes up?<br>
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-heading">Solution</p>
                <p class="text-sub-heading">What does targeted audience look like?</p>
                <p class="text-body">Well they are going to be technical college students from 1st year to final Year. And with their main focus in the field Computer Science </p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">Do we need an Online Interface?</p>
                <p class="text-body">It may seem like the obvious one but this is important to get everyone on the same page or Table at least. Because we want to keep record of all the data, keep track of the performance of students, and want everything highly managed with minimal efforts. So yup we need it.</p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">What features are required and are necessary?</p>
                <p class="text-body">We didn’t wanted to spend our time and resources providing a tons of functionality but the basic one so we stick with our objectives
                </p>
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>Student’s Profile</li>
                    <li>Online assignments / Projects Submission</li>
                    <li>Report Card</li>
                    <li>Lecture Summary and Resources</li>
                    <li>Notifications for upcoming classes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">How the dashboard will be used?</p>
                <p class="text-body">As we are training students to be programmer, Developers and Designers they must have laptops with them as the part of the programme and they will need Dashboard to submit the assignments and projects. So we decided to make a web-Interface for Desktop only.</p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">Features that user will need to use most frequently?</p>
                <p class="text-body">User will need to review the delivered lectures regular basically every day to check for additional resources and to master that particular topic. So estimate 70% users will use that regularly.
                <br>
                After that Assignment and project submission is mandatory so all users will need to use that feature.<br>
                    Report Card section is also expected to be used heavily after assignment submission<br>
                    Let’s see after collecting some data from first test Run
            
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">How much time they can/will spend on that dashboard?</p>
                <p class="text-body">A typical user will spend from 3 minute to 30 minutes on the Dashboard regularly.</p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">Why will they visit the Dashboard?</p>
                <p class="text-body">Every user will need Dashboard for submitting Assignment and Projects.<br>
But about 30% of users are estimated to use dashboard regularly for reviewing lectures and additional resources.
</p>
                
                <p class="text-sub-heading">If user is not on dashboard how will we notify if something important comes up?</p>
                <p class="text-body">Critical situations are when a student is about to miss an assignment or project or if he/she is late. Then we can notify the user using Text massage or via email.</p>
               
                <p class="text-heading">User Research (Phase 1)</p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    This was an early phase research before we jumped into making something we wanted to get insight into the daily routine of different kinds of students in a classroom.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sub-heading">Research Goals</p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    To establish Personas for different type of class students<br>
                    To get an insight of their preferences<br>
                    To understand how they spend their day and how much flexibility they can provide
